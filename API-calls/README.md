# Random Cat Facts & Dog Images Web App 

This is a simple web application that fetches random cat facts and random dog images using public APIs. It’s built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Axios for API requests.

- Features
1. Display random cat facts on button click.
2. Display random dog images on button click.
3. Simple and clean UI with responsive styling.
4. Easy to extend for more APIs or features.

- Technologies Used
1. HTML5 – Structure of the web page.
2. CSS3 – Styling the layout, buttons, and content.
3. JavaScript (ES6) – Fetching API data and updating the UI dynamically.
4. Axios – HTTP client to make API requests.

- Public APIs:

1. Cat Facts API (https://catfact.ninja/fact) – Fetch random cat facts.
2. Dog CEO API (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) – Fetch random dog images.

- How It Works

1. Cat Facts
When you click the “Show new facts” button, the app calls the Cat Facts API.
The API responds with a random cat fact which is displayed inside the facts div.

2. Dog Images
When you click the “Show new images” button, the app calls the Dog CEO API.
The API responds with a random dog image URL which is displayed in the image element.
