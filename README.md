# JavaScript Projects

This repository features four mini JavaScript projects, each designed to strengthen your understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and API integration.

Projects Included: 

1. Calling APIs – Learn how to fetch data from external APIs and display it dynamically on a webpage.

2. Generating Random Colours – Use Math.random() to generate random RGB colour values and update the UI interactively.

3. Simon Says Game – An interactive memory game built entirely using DOM manipulation.

4. Todo App – A functional todo application demonstrating dynamic element creation, event handling, and state management.

Each project contains its own README.md with detailed setup instructions and explanations.

These projects were specially developed to provide hands-on experience with core JavaScript concepts, helping build confidence in creating interactive web applications.
