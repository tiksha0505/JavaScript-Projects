# Todo List App

A simple Todo List web application built to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates dynamic DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic interactivity.

- Features
1. Add new tasks using the input field and “Add task” button.
2. Mark tasks as complete using checkboxes (with strike-through effect).
3. Delete tasks individually.
4. Simple, clean, and colorful interface.

- Demo
1. Open html file in your browser to use the app.
2. Type a task and click Add task to create a new item.
3. Check the box to mark a task complete.
4. Click Delete to remove a task.

- Technologies Used
1. HTML5 – Page structure and layout.
2. CSS3 – Styling tasks, buttons, and input fields.
3. JavaScript (ES6) – Adding, deleting, and marking tasks dynamically.

- How It Works
1. Add Task – JavaScript listens for the Add task button click, creates new list items with a checkbox and delete button, and appends them to the list.
2. Mark Complete – Checking a box applies a strike-through effect to indicate task completion.
3. Delete Task – Clicking the Delete button removes the corresponding task from the list.
4. Existing tasks also respond to checkbox changes for completion styling.

- Usage
1. Open the app in a browser
2. Enter a task in the input field.
3. Click Add task to add it to the list.
4. Check the box to mark a task complete.
5. Click Delete to remove a task.
